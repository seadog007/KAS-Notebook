"romance‚Äù in America, it is inevitable that women are highly regarded, and that this high regard be extended to financial considerations.

I have been equally surprised by the conquests made in business by American women. It is rather a shock to a European to meet a pretty girl of twenty-seven, to hear that she is employed in a drug corporation, and then to discover that she is a director. A shock to find a woman running a lawyer's office entailing annual expenses of seven or eight thousand dollars, and making a living. It is a surprise to find the American stenographer earning four times as much as her European sister. All those shocks, however, arise out of particular instances, and, though I agree that the American woman has made herself a good position, when I go through a business reference book I find that not one in a hundred of the leading names is the name of a woman. In America man still rules; all you can say is that he does not rule women so harshly as he does in Europe.

Ain't it the truth that some will go to any length to earn pin money (spending money), as it were? Why, I've been reading lately in the papers about any number of the so-called weaker sex that have been invading the particular fields that the men have been surest was their very own, and getting away whith it, too-especially in these United States. And far be it from me to say them nay, for why shouldn't they be given a chance when they're proving right and left that they're able in plenty to fill the bill-and hang on to their femininity at the same time?

Personally, I wouldn't be so keen about trying some of the stunts I've been reading about. But ladies must live, and if some of them prefer dangerous stuff, why, I say, let them have it. Still, just among ourselves, I think even if I did hanker after the rough stuff I could find something a little less exciting than octopus hunting to satisfy my emotional and mercenary demands!

Yes, sir, that's just what a lots of them are doing catching octopuses or devilfish, out of Salon Beach, Washington, for $40 and $50 a month! They can catch as many as seven a day sometims, and they sell them to the Chinese and Japanese for 10 cents a pound, all of which makes the sport quite profitable, if you look at it that way...

But if you are "East" you don't have to go west to find women doing men's work and keeping up with fashion, too.

You know Women are getting into more things that are embarrassing to them men. You see the first idea of giving them the vote was just to use the vote. But the Women contrary like they are, they wasent satisfied with that. They started to take this equality thing serious. They begin to think they really was somebody. The women figured that"While we may not be as good as a Man, we are at least as good Politician." So the Scamps commenced to want to get in on the loot. As soon as they found out a Political Job tool no experience to hold, that it only took experience to get, why they commenced to making themselves rather embarrassing around the Political employment Bureau, and now every one of them call themselves as a Number 2 Company of Mabel W. Willerbrandt. It was all right with the men when the women took the little Committee assignments where there was NO salary connected, but when they started to want to put their powdered nose into the feed trough, why that brought on complications. Now they are wondering, "Was the Women's vote worth waht they are asking for it?"...

But this Nineteenth Amendment is worrying more people in the Country than the Eighteenth.... The men give 'em the vote, and never meant for them to take it seriously. But being Women they took the wrong meaning and did.

The vote won, some women ask, "Has it been worth the trouble it cost?" Some men ask, "What good has it done?" "What change has it wrought?" "Is the new way better than the old?"
