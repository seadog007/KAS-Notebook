During the time of Revolutionary War "It was almost universally believed that a woman's brain was smaller in capacity and therefore inferior in quality to that of am man." 

Incredibly property-owning New Jersey women could vote from 1776 to 1807. This was eventually taken away.

##Early 19th century Women
1. Unable to vote.
2. Legal status of a minor.
3. Single -> could own her own property.
4. Married -> no control over her property or her children.
5. Could not initiate divorce.
6. Couldn't make wills, sign a contract, or bring suit in court withour her husband's perssion.

A woman's "sphere" was in the home (if was a refuge from the cruel world outside)
Her role was to "civilize" and educate her husband and family.

The conflict over slavery in the USA and the radical aboliton movement (abolition is the movement to end slavery) had a great impact on women's rights.

Women in the abolition movement recognized parallels between the legal condition of slaves and that of women

Participation in the Anti-Slavery movement helped women develop public-speaking and argumentative skills that carried over into the women's right movement

Elizabth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott met in 1848 to organize a convention to promote "social, civil, and religious rights of women."

##The Seneca Falls Women's Rights Convention, 1848
The Seneca Falls Convention was the "birthplace of the women's rights movement."

War, and the Reconstruction that followed, split, but nevertheless furthered the Women's Rights movement.

The 15th Amendment to the Constitution added "male" to its definition of eligible voters- women would need another amendment explicityly grantion them the franchise.

##Two Orgnaizations are Formed
- National Woman Suffrage Assiciation (NWSA)
  - Founded by Anthony and Stanton
  - The more radical woman's suffrage group
  - Accepted only women and opposed the Fourteenth Amendment since it only enfranchised African-American men.
- American Woman Suffrage Assiciation (AWSA)
  - More moderate in its views than the NWSA
  - Allowed men to join and rallied behind the Fourteenth Amendment as a step in the right direction toward grater civil rights for women
  - Leaders of the AWSA included Juila Ward Howe and Lucy Stone.

When the two groups reunited in 1890, the new National American Woman Suffrage Assiciation (NAWSA) followed the direction set by Anthony and Stanton.

After 1890, increasing competition among political parties made women's suffrage a hot politcal issue.

Between 1900 and 1920, the woman suffrage movemnet modernized, adoption new tactics of lobbying, advertising, and grassroots organizing under the leadership of Carrie Chapman Catt.

Growing opposition fostered a sense of impatience among women who had waited over 50 years since the Seneca Falls Convention for the vote.

The Woman's Party was one of the first groups --

World War I interrupted the campaign for woman suffrage, but in the end, this conflict would cause some social upheaval and ultimately lead to social change for women.

Women's work during the war allowed them to claim the right of patriotic citizenship.
