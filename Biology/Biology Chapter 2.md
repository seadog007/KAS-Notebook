##Life Function
If a living thing has all 8 of these life functions, it iis called an **organism**.
  - Reproduction: the process by which living things produce new living things of the same kind
    - Asexual
    - Sexual
  - Respiration: the process of breathing or through which energy is released from nutrient molecules
    - Breathing
    - Cellular respiration
  - Regulation: the processes that control and coordinate the many activities of a living thing
  - Excretion: the process by which living things remove waste products produced by cell activities
    - Liquid
    - Gas
    - Differnt with elimination (solid)
  - Growth: the process by which living increase in size or cell number
  - Nutrition: the process by which living things take in materials from its environment for growth and repair
    - Autotrophic
    - Heterotrophic
      - Ingestion
        - Take foods
      - Digestion
        - Break foods to smaller pieces
      - Assimilation
        - Break bigger molecule to smaller molecule
        - Under the microscope level
      - Absorption
        - Absorp the energy
      - Egestion
        - To discharge waste
  - Trasport: the process by which usable materials are taken into the living thing and distributed throughout the living thing
    - Diffusion
      - High concentration -> Low concentration
    - Active transport
      - Require energy
    - passive transport
  - Synthesis: the process by which smaller, simple substances are combined chemically
  
When we refer to all of the life functions of an organism, we are reffering to its **metabolism**: the total of all the life functions requeired to sustain life (to stay alive)

An organism's external (outside) environment is always changing. By keeping the control and regulation of its metabolic activities, an organism can maintain a stable internal (inside) environment. This is called **homeostasis**.
  - The process by which an organism's metabolic activities are in a state of balance.
  Example:
    - Body temperture
    - Blood sugar levels
