##Scientific Method
###Steps in the Scientific Method
  1. Observing
  2. Problem
  3. Research
  4. Hypothesis
    - Must be testable
  5. Experiment (trial)
  6. Data (trend)
    - Guantitative (number)
      - Type
        - accurate
        - precise
      - Example:
        - correct: 10
        - accurate: 9.9, 10, 10.2
        - precise: 2.2, 2.5, 3.1
    - Gualitative (description)
  7. Conclusion
  8. Communiate

###Control Experiment
  - **"1"** independent variable = `experimental treatment`
    - Change
    - x-axis

  - Dependent variable
    - result
    - y-axis

  - Controlled variable = `constants`
    - Unchanged

###Redi's Blowfly Experiment
  - Spontaneous generation
    - Living things arise from nonliving things
    - had been proof that is wrong
  
  - Meterials
    - Rotting meat
    - Beaker
    - Cover

  - Variable
    - Independent variable: the cover
    - Dependent variable: the number of maggots
    - Controlled Variable: same temperture...

  - Biogenesis
    - Living things arise from living things

  - Rule to become a theory or a law
    - If can describe some situations -> **theory**
    - If can describe all situations -> **law**

##Experiment Data
###T-Test
  - Compare 2 data sets
  - P-value
    - 0.01 means 1% of data sets are the same
    - \>0.05: no significant difference
    - <0.05: significant difference

##Microscope
####Light Microscope
  - IP (eyepiece) and objective lenses.
  - Less magnification
  - Smaller size
  - Cheaper
  - Require thin objective
  - Colorful
  - Can observing living and nonliving things

###Electron Microscope
  - Two different types
    - Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)
    - Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM)
  - Better magnification
  - Bigger size
  - Expensive
  - Electron
  - Black and White
  - Can only observing nonliving things
    - Because it the objective need to in the vaccum chamber

###Term
  - Power of magnification: the increase in objective's size (Eyepiece * Objtive lense)
  - Resolving power: Tell the difference between 2 points
  - Field of view: Area seen under the microscope
