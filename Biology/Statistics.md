###Reasons for usign statistics
Pass

###Mean, range, standard deviation and error bars
  - Mean: the average of data points
  - Range: the measure of the spread of data
    - largest - smallest
  - Standard deviation: the measure of how the individual observations of a data set are dispersed or spread out around the mean
  - Error bars: the graphical representation of the variability of data

###Standard deviation
  - Summarizing the spread of values around the mean

###Significant difference between two data sets using the t-test
Pass

value of r: correlation, vary from +1~-1
  - +1: completely correlation
  - 0: no correlation
  - -1: completely negative correlation
