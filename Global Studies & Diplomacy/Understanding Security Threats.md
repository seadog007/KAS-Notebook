  - Elevated
  - Guarded

##Elements of National Security
  - Military Security
    The nation is able to defend itself from, or deter, military aggression (foreign or domestic). This can also be extended to refer to the capability of a nation to enforce its decisions through military force.
  - Political Security
    The nation is able to defend and protect the stability of the existing political/social order.
  - Economic Security
    The nation is able to protect freedom to develop its economy in the way it desires.
  - Evnironmental Security
    The nation is able to protect itself from enironmental issues that threaten the wellbeing of the nation in any way.
    These can be transnational environmental issues in a board sense, such as global warming, or specific environmental situations that can cause other types of security threats.
  - Energy/resource Security
    The nation is able to protect its access to energy and natural resources in order to develop its industrial and economic capabilities and power.

##Types of Security Threats
  1. Physical threat: there is a real danger incolved for the physical safety of a country, its property or its citizens.
  2. Information Threat: this involves the "leak" of knowledge that could pose a security risk threatening one of the elements of national security.
  3. Environmental Threat: in this context, "environmental" does not mean the environment in the green sense used above, or necessarily as part of the natural world. Instead, in this category a countries "environment" means its total surroundings, which may be natural , or it may be political, geographic, social, etc.
  
##Immediacy of Threats
  1. Aggressive Threat: this is a near term, even immediate threat where someone is actively pursuing policies or actions to harm some element of your national security
  2. Passive Threat: a passive threat is all about potential. Someone may have the intention of threatening your national security but hasn't acturally done anything about it (for example, the former President of Iran said he wanted to wipe Israel off the map, but didn't acctually do anything to militarily threaten Israel.)

##Economic
###Economic Security
  - The nation is able to protect the freedom to develop its economy in the way it desires
  - When there is a disagressment between countries, one common way negotiate is to thereaten another country's economic security.

###Economic Sanctions
  - What: "economic sanctions" means the deliberate, government-inspired withdrawal, or threat of withdrawal, of customary trade or financial relation.
  - Why?
    - To punish
    - To deter (signals displeasure)
    - To rehabilitate
    - To appease

###Who imposes economic sanctions?
  - Individual countries
  - Temporary coalitions
  These sender countries may impose economic sanctions on a target country in order to achieve various foreign policy goals.

###How are they implemented?
  1. with trade sanctions that limit the target country's exports or restrict its imports
    1. Imposing limits on exports from the target country reduces foreign sale and exchange
    2. Imposing limits on exports from the sender country can deprive the target country of needed goods.
    3. A complete restriction of trade is called an embarge
  2. with financial sanctions that restrict their banking or commerce (include reducing aid).

###Recent trends
  - Often focus on military goods
  - Sometimes freeze target's assets in other countries
  - Smart sanctions: intended to focus on the leaders of a country, and only target things, such as luxury goods, that leaders will benefit from, and not quell discontent from the general population.

###Result?
  - Often have economic impact, but do not tend to affect the leadership
  - They can breed dislike from the people of a country that suffer as a result of sanctions, and this may cause them to become more nationalistic
  - So they are mostly used to signal to a country as a warning to change or there may be stronger consequences.

##Force and Weapons
###Conventional Forces: Controlling Territory
  - Conventional armies remain very important when controlling territory.
  - Reasons for controlling territory:
    - Annexing
    - Forcing enemy to take a particular action
    - Control of resources
  - Important army elements:
    - Infantry (foot soldiers)
    - Armor (tanks)
    - Artillery (cannons, rockets)
    - Air (helicopters and planes)

###Conventional Forces: Controlling Seas
  - Conventional vaval forces are deployed for controlling the seas.
  - Reasons for controlling seas:
    - COntrol supplu lines
    - Attack enemy coastlines
    - Power projection: which a nation that has a powerful modern navy can send forces to a conflict area and influence the actions of other states with a threat of overwhelming conventional firepower
  - Important naval force elements:
    - Aircraft carriers ($$$)
    - Warship
    - Submarine

###Convertional Forces: Controlling Skies
  - Conventional air forces are deployed for controlling the skies
  - Reasons for controlling the skies
    - Strategic bombing
    - Control of airspace
    - Reconnaissance (observation of an area to find an enemy or determine strategy)
    - Close air support (bombing battlefields to help land armies)
  - Important air force elements
    - Fighter bomber
    - Cruise missle
    - Unmanned drones

###Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD)
  - The potentially most dangerous form of milltary leverage availabe
  - BUt fears of using them are high due to their massive destructive potential
  - Extremely unlikely states would actually employ them in armed conflict
  - So not really a solution
###WMD: Nuclear Weapons
  - Have only been used in war twice (US -> Japan in WWII)
  - Act as leverage
  - The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) was created in 1968 with the goals of:
    - Preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and technology
    - Promiting cooperation in peaceful use of Nuclear energy
    - Achieving nuclear disarmament
  - Currenly signed by all countries/states except:
    - India
    - Israel
    - Pakistan
    - South Sudan
    - North Korea (only member to ever withdraw, 2003)

###WMD: Chemical Weapons
  - Chemical weapons: a weapon or device designed to spread a man-made chemical of some sort to disable of kill large number of people.
    - Ex. Mustard Gas (forms blisters on skin and lungs), Lethal nerve gas (attack the nervous system)
  - Geneva Protocol (1925) prohibited use of chemical weapons
  - Rarely used after WWI
    - Exceptions Iraq -> Iran
    - Iraq on Kurdish citizens

###WMD: Biological Weapons
  - Biological weapon: a harmful living thing (such as a germ that causes disease) used as a weapon in a war
  - Unlikely to be used
  - Examples:
    - Viruses, plagues such a s smallpox, anthrax

###Unconventional Forces: Guerrillas
  - a member of a small independent group taking part in irregular fighting, typically against larger regular forces. They do not have authorization and are not offical soldiers.
    - Ex. The group of civilians who work to protectthe village in Blood Diamond.
  - Tactics:
    - try to attack their enemy in their soft spots (such as supply routes) behind the battle lines
    - use hit and run tactics against larger numbers of the enemy to disrupt the enemy's ability to fight.
  - If the security threat is an unfriendly government, states may often send weapons, money, or technical assistance to rebels or guerrilla movements (or terrorists) operating against that government.
    - For example, after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, the USSA felt the Soviets were getting too close to oil in the Middle East.
    - US CIA sent weapons and advisers to afghan rebels and non-Afghan Muslim fighters helping them, to wage a guerrilla war against the Soviet troops.
    - Successful in driving the Soviets out of Afghanistan, but some of those guerrillas later became the Taliban.
