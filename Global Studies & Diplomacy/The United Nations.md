##Pre-United Nations (UN)
###Background: the League of Nations
  - Before the United Nations, there was the League of Nations
	- The League of Nations was founded in 1920 during the Paris Peace Conference that ended WWI
	- It was compriesd of:
		- ageneral assmbly (all member states)
		- an executive council (only major world powers)
		- permant secretariat

###Weaknesses of the League of Nations
  - the United States did not join
	  - the senate blocked ratification particularly because of Article X of the Covenant of the League of Nations which is the section calling for assistance to be given to a member that experiences external aggression.
  - Russia refused to join
  - Germany was not allowed to join
  - Method of peacekeeping
	  - collective security
		- community of poewr
		- moral persuasion

###Powers of the League
If the moral persuasion method of peacekeeping failed, the League had three powers it could use to make countries do as it wanted, Theoretically, the League was able to use military force, but the League did not have an army of its own - so if a country ignored it, in the end, there was nothing the League could do.
  - Condemnation (The League could tell a country it was doing wrong)
	- Arbitration (the League could offer to decide between two countries)
	- Sanctions (stopping trade)

###Collective Security vs National Sovereignty
  - Collective Security:
    Collective security is one type of coalition building strategy in which a group of nations agree not to attack each other and to defend each other against an attack from one of the others, if such an attack is made.
    Nation ague to work together to defend each other
  - National Sovereignty:
    In a federal system of government, sovereignty also refers to powers which a constituent state or republic possesses independently of the national government.
    The independence of a nation without other nations interfirng

##Formation of the League of Nations
###Difference in Formation
  - League of Nations formed after WWI;  structure of UN was established and sdiscussed during WWII
  - League of Nations part of larger peace conference ending WWI; UN charter had its own independent conference
  - League of Nations chater was primarily decided by five major powers (France, Italy, Japan, the UK, the US); UN charter was created by 50 nations represented at the 1945 San Francisco Conference

###Differences in Voting
  - In the League of Nations, all voting had to be unanimousl the UN decided that all its organs and subsidiary bodies should make decisions by a majority vote.
	  - There are some exceptions for the UN such as the Security Council P5 and an occasional controversial matter.
  - Differeneces in Preventing and Ending War
	  - the League of Nations forbid "aggression" but did not prevent nations from declaring war as long as it had gone through the process provided by the League of Nations
		- the United Nations does not recognize any legal reasons for declaring war; Article 51 states that nations have the right to self-defense (responding to an attack) but not to initate the attack
		- the Security Council of the United Nations has the right to decide if a threat to the peace exists and can impose sanctions.

###Membership
  - the League of Nations was missing several major world pwers as members (the US, Germany, USSR) and several states withdrwe in order to act aggressively
	- the United Nations has a membership of 193 nations with the exclusion of
	  - Taiwan (recongnized by 21 nations)
	  - Kosovo (recongnized by 108 nations)
	  - Vatican City (recognized by 180 naiotns, represented by the Holy See which has full membership except for voting)

###Preamble of UN
  - http://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/preamble/index.html
	- We the peoples of the united nations determined
    - to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind, and
    - to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small, and
	  - to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained, and
		- to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom,
  - And for these ends
  	- to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours, and
	  - to unite our strength to maintain international peace and security, and
	  - to ensure, by the acceptance of principles and the institution of methods, that armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest, and
	  - to employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples,
  - Have resolved to combine our efforts to accomplish these aims
	  - Accordingly, our respective Governments, through representatives assembled in the city of San Francisco, who have exhibited their full powers found to be in good and due form, have agreed to the present Charter of the United Nations and do hereby establish an international organization to be known as the United Nations.

  - The United Nations has 5 main bodies
	  - Gerneral Assembly
		- Security Council
		- ECOSOC

##Trusteeship Council
###Introduction
  - Established in 1945 to
    - procide international supervision for 11 Trust Territories that had been placed under the administration of seven Member States
    - encsure that adequate steps were taken to prepare the Territories for self-government and independence

	By 1994, all Trust Territories had attained self-government or independence. The Trusteeship Council suspended operation on 1 November 1994. Agreed to meet as occasion required -- by decision of its President, a majority of its members, the GA, or the Security Council.

###Trusteeship Council Members
  -  all U.N. members administering trust territories
  -  the five permanent members of the Security Council
  -  as many other non-administering members as needed to equalize the number of administering and non-administering members
	Today, as there are no longer any trust territories, the members only include the Security Council five permanent members.

###Potential Futures of the Trusteeship Council
  - to act as a regulatory body to protect environmental integrity and the global commons of land outside national jurisdictions
  - the complete elimination of the Trusteeship Council was proposed in 2004 by Kofi Annan
	  - However, the format elimination of the Trusteeship Council would require the revision of the UN Charter, which is why it has not been pursued unless*

###The work of the UN
  - Peace and Security
  - Development
  - Human Rights: GA, ECOSOC
  - Humanitarian Affairs
  - International Law
For each area of work done by the UN, what committees would be most likely to address it and what could be at least three exa,ple topics that would fall under the aspect?
